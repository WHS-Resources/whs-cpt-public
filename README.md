## About

The Westlake High School Competitive Programming Tournament (WHS-CPT) is an annual computer science competition held at Westlake. WHSCPT 2021 will be held online using the HackerRank platform. There will be one division containing a fair share of both beginner and advanced problems. For any questions go to this [Google Form](https://forms.gle/RbtGpYLuZUQuWBqv6)

If you are not registered already, you can do so [here](https://forms.gle/fcmr9fb9rxgRyi49A).

## Problem Difficulty Samples

Here are several sample topics (without the problem statement). Some of these may appear in the contest!

If you are looking to study for this contest, we strongly recommend checking out past [USACO](http://www.usaco.org/) problems.

### Easy

1. ASCII art (output).
2. Given a set of integers, determine the largest number in the set that is smaller than `n` (control statements).
3. Is the current day a leap year? (modulus)

### Medium

1. Find the shortest path given a directed graph (Dijkstra's).
2. Given a list of numbers, sort the numbers by their absolute value, and then place the positive numbers before the negative numbers (Sorting).
3. Given endpoints of "carpet layers," with form `[a, b]` determine the number of layers of carpet at any point `p` (prefix sums).
4. Print all the shortest paths from a 3d point `a,b,c` to `d,e,f` (breadth first search).

### Hard

1. Given a set of P discrete points, find a triangulation such that no point in P is inside the circumcircle of any triangle in the triangulation of P (Delaunay Triangulation).
2. Find the maximum distance between any two points in O(nlogn) time (Divide and Conquer).
3. Calculate the polygon area if the lower hull were to be separated from the upper hull by a distance of `n` (Andrew's Monotone Chain).
